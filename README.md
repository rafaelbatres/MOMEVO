MOMEVO (Multi-Objective Metamodel-based Evolutionary Optimizer)

MOMEVO is a surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm developed to address the challenges of computationally expensive optimization
tasks commonly encountered in engineering and other domains.

One of the core contributions of MOMEVO is its distance-based candidate selection mechanism, promoting global exploration more effectively than traditional
criteria. Additionally, it features an iterative search-space reduction framework that adaptively focuses on high-potential regions while maintaining global coverage.
MOMEVO’s modular architecture allows dynamic switching between Gaussian Processes and ensemble models, enhancing robustness in challenging landscapes. To explore the solution space effectively, MOMEVO uses evolutionary
operators such as crossover and Gaussian mutation.

MOMEVO was developed by Rafael Batres
